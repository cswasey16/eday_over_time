                "
88,88,"Glenn Thrush, in Washington",1604800422000,"

                    Biden said his mandate is to find common ground to “cooperate” with Republicans, pivoting to the center after embracing the party’s liberal wing during the general election.

                    A line Biden has been using for a while now but that has particular significance tonight: He says that he has run as a proud Democrat but will govern as an American president.




                "
93,93,"Glenn Thrush, in Washington",1604800201000,"

                    In contrast to Trump, whose speeches are paeans of self-praise, Biden is crediting others, and allowed Harris to deliver a powerful speech without apparent concern about being upstaged.




                "
94,94,"Adam Nagourney, in Los Angeles",1604800164000,"

                    “This is the time to heal in America.” Biden is signaling the big early themes of his presidency. Covid-19. Health care. Racial justice. Climate change.

95,95,"Adam Nagourney, in Los Angeles",1604800106000,"

                    “I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything.” In case there was any doubt, Biden is very different than the man he is replacing in the White House.

                    If there's any consolation for Democrats, this Miami-Dade result, way worse for Biden than expected, is not something we expect to see repeated elsewhere in the country.

                    Retirees in the Villages, Fla., are a politically conservative lot. If Biden is cutting into Trump’s coalition with older voters, we should see some support in Sumter County.
